# Closures and objects

## Isomorphic code

Two sets of code are isomorphic if you can convert from one set of code statements to 
another set of code statements and vice versa.

Code written using closures can be converted into code written using literal objects and vice versa.

Thus closures and objects are isomorphic representations of state and its associated functionality.
